This guide will describe the steps taken to get an Edge Impulse continuous motion classification model working on the Reloc brickML development board. 

## Architecture
This example splits inference and sensor acquisition into two separate threads that communicate by using a queue. For now the example is very basic, with a one-element queue, but allows for further scalability. For example having a single data aquisition thread, and multiple inference threads, running in parallel, or semi-sequentially. 

#### Data acquisition thread 
The data acquisition thread connects to the on-board BNO055 motion sensors and wraps the data into the `sensorFrame` struct.

If the data read from the sensor is successful, data gets sent trough the `sensorQueue` to be consumed by the inference thread. 

Our example is running a classifier on IMU data and tries to fit samples into the **moving** and **not moving** categories.  It's trained on the acceleration, gyro and euler angles of the BNO055 sensors.
```c
 struct sensorFrame {
    float accX = 0.00;
    float accY = 0.00;
    float accZ = 0.00;
    float gyroX = 0.00;
    float gyroY = 0.00;
    float gyroZ = 0.00;
    float pitch = 0.00;
    float roll = 0.00;
    float yaw = 0.00;
};
```

#### Inference thread

The Inference thread checks if there is any space available in the queue `sensorsQueue` and if there is, it receives the data from the queue and stores it in the global feature array. It then checks if the feature array is filled and if it is it calls the inference function and reset the feature_ix.

The `inference()` function is then defined. This function uses the Edge Impulse SDK to create a signal from the "features" array, run the classifier on this signal, and print the results to the serial port. It creates a struct `ei_impulse_result_t` named result, creates a signal from the features frame by calling `numpy::signal_from_buffer(features, EI_CLASSIFIER_DSP_INPUT_FRAME_SIZE, & signal)` and then runs the classifier with the `run_classifier( & signal, & result, true)` call. It then prints the return code from the classifier, how long it took to perform inference and the prediction results on the serial port.

## Prerequisites & Configuration
### 1. Heap & Stack Size
Both the inference functionality and calling `printf` on floats, abuse the stack and heap quite a lot. That's why we need to increase both the heap size and the stack sizes for our threads. 

First, go to the BSP Tab in the **FSP Configuration** and under **RA Common** set the **Main stack size** and **Heap size** to 0x4000 (16384) bytes.

Now, for each thread that runs inference and/or uses `printf`, change the stack and heap size too.

Feel free to tweak the settings to your liking, but these settings have worked for me.

### 2. Printing floats 
This example includes some custom wrappers i have written for accessing USB, UART and I2C interfaces, code that is mainly based on the Reloc examples. 

This simplifies access to USB serial, and allows us to `printf` to the console with a variable number of arguments. Under the hood, this uses `vsnprintf`. 

Due to the fact that `printf` is not re-entrant and uses a lot of heap space for floats, we need to do some configurations. 

#### 2.1. Enable newlib-nano
Go to **Project Settings > C/C++ Build > Settings > GNU Arm Cross C++ Linker > Miscellaneous** and enable :
* **Use newlib-nano** 
* **Use float with nano printf**

#### 2.2. Enable Newlib Reentrant 
For the thread that prints floats we also need to enable **Use Newlib Reentrant** on the **Stacks** page of **FSP Configuration** and selecting the thread we are interested in.

### 3. Configure the Renesas E2 Environment to work with Edge Impulse
Next up, we need to configure the E2 environment to compile and link with the **Edge Impulse SDK**. 

First off, download your model from Edge Impulse, unzip the archive and move the three folders:
**edge-impulse-sdk**, **model-parameters** and **tflite-model**, to the root of your solution in the **/src** folder. 

Go to **Project Settings > C/C++ Build > Settings > C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols > Symbols**, add **EI_PORTING_RENESASRA65**, and set it's value to 1.

### 4. Modifications to the Edge Impulse SDK port for RA6M5
From my personal experience, it seems like the RA6M5 port of edge impulse is missing some includes, and has some half-backed implementations. Here's my tweaked code. 
Please note that I just ignored the `ei_printf` method as it's redundant. 

Go to `<your_project_name>/src/edge-impulse-sdk/porting/renesas-ra6m5/ei_classifier_porting.cpp`  and paste the following code: 
```c 
//#include <fsp_common_api.h>
/* Includes */
#include "../ei_classifier_porting.h"

#if EI_PORTING_RENESASRA65 == 1
#include "bsp_api.h"
#include "FreeRTOS.h"
#include "task.h"

#include <stdio.h>

    length = vsnprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), format, myargs);

        }

```
### 5. Add a global queue. 
The last configuration step we need to take is to create the queue that we'll use to communicate between threads. Go to the **Stacks** tab of the **FSP Configuration** environment, and create a new object. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/3iU5KAn.png)

It's really important to set it's size accordingly. In our case, the struct we are sending trough the queue has 9 floats, so the **Item Size** should be set to **36 bytes**.
